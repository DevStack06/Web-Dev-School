students from naxal affected areas so that they are able to secure their career by securing
selection in national level competitive examinations. Seats for students are reserved in the
following pattern: ST(50%), SC(20%), OBC(20%) and General 10%.We sincerely believe that education is not learning of facts instead it is a training
which makes a mind to think and imagine. That is  the reason we use technology &amp;
innovative methods which allows students to think more and memorise less which
will help them to excel in whatever field they choose. Â If you dream to be an
engineer or a doctor and commit yourself to do the smart work then PRAYAS is the
